# Messaging Service Prototype

## 1. Introduction

**Name:** Abhay Patel  
**Institute:** IIT Dhanbad  
**Course:** Computer Science and Engineering (2026)

The messaging service prototype is designed to facilitate real-time communication between users through text messages. It includes user registration, authentication, one-on-one messaging, group chat functionality, and real-time message updates.

---

## 2. System Overview

The system comprises a frontend and a backend, allowing users to register, authenticate, and send/receive messages. Real-time updates are facilitated via WebSockets.

---

## 3. System Architecture

**Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL)  
**WebSockets:** Socket.io

---

## 4. Data Flow Diagram

### User Registration & Authentication:
- Users interact with the React frontend.
- Authentication requests are sent to the Node.js backend.
- User data is stored in MongoDB.

### Messaging & Group Chat:
- Users exchange messages through the React frontend.
- Real-time updates are managed via WebSocket connections.
- Messages are stored in MongoDB.

---

## 5. Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Chakra UI:** A component library for designing accessible and customizable UIs.

### Backend:
- **Node.js:** A runtime for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js.

### Database:
- **MongoDB (NoSQL):** Chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and JSON-like document storage.

### WebSockets:
- **Socket.io:** A library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication.

---

## 6. System Components

### Frontend:
- **React.js:** Responsible for the user interface, user registration, and message interaction.
- **Chakra UI:** Provides the design system, components, and UI elements.

### Backend:
- **Node.js:** Manages the server and APIs for user authentication and message handling.
- **Express.js:** Facilitates route handling and middleware integration.
- **MongoDB:** Stores user data and messages in a NoSQL database.
- **Socket.io:** Enables real-time communication and message updates.

---

## 7. Security and Privacy

### Authentication:
- User registration is secured via **bcrypt** hashing and token-based authentication (**JWT**).
- Passwords are never stored in plain text.

### Privacy:
- User data is protected, and privacy is maintained through authentication and authorization controls.

---

## 8. Scalability and Performance
- The system can be horizontally scaled by adding more backend servers and utilizing MongoDB's sharding capabilities.
- Real-time messaging is optimized for performance through WebSockets.

---

## 9. Dependencies and Libraries

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **express** | Used to build the RESTful API |
| **mongoose** | ODM library for MongoDB interaction |
| **socket.io** | Facilitates real-time messaging |

---

## 10. Deployment and Infrastructure

Deployment is done on GitHub. Infrastructure needs include virtual machines, databases, and WebSocket support.
